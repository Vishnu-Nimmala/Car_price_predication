## 📌 What is This Project?

This project is a **Car Price Prediction System** — a web application built using **Machine Learning** and **Flask**.

When a user visits the website, they fill in details about a car like:
- Which brand it is (Tesla, BMW, Toyota, etc.)
- What year it was made
- How big the engine is
- Whether it runs on Petrol or Diesel
- Whether it has Manual or Automatic transmission
- How many kilometres it has been driven (Mileage)
- What condition it is in (New / Used / Like New)
- What model it is (Model X, Mustang, Innova, etc.)

After filling all these details and clicking **Predict Price**, the system uses a trained Machine Learning model to calculate and display the **estimated price of the car**.

This is very useful for:
- A **buyer** who wants to know if a car price is fair
- A **seller** who wants to set a reasonable price
- A **dealer** who wants to quickly estimate car values

## 🎯 Why Did I Build This Project?

I built this project because:
- I wanted to learn how Machine Learning works on real data
- I wanted to connect a Python ML model with a website using Flask
- I wanted to understand how different car features like year, mileage, and brand affect the final price
- I wanted to build a complete project from collecting data, training a model, building a website, and deploying it live
- This project helps me grow as a **Data Analyst and ML Engineer**

## 🧮 Manual Calculations (Step by Step)

### 📍 Step 1 — Label Encoding (Converting Text to Numbers)

Machine Learning models cannot understand text like "BMW" or "Petrol". So we convert all text values into numbers. This is called **Label Encoding**.

| Brand | Number |
|---|---|
| Tesla | 0 |
| BMW | 1 |
| Audi | 2 |
| Ford | 3 |
| Honda | 4 |
| Mercedes | 5 |
| Toyota | 6 |

| Fuel Type | Number |
|---|---|
| Petrol | 0 |
| Diesel | 1 |

| Transmission | Number |
|---|---|
| Manual | 0 |
| Automatic | 1 |

| Condition | Number |
|---|---|
| New | 0 |
| Used | 1 |
| Like New | 2 |

| Model | Number |
|---|---|
| Model X | 0 |
| 5 Series | 1 |
| A4 | 2 |
| Mustang | 3 |
| City | 4 |
| C Class | 5 |
| Innova | 6 |

### 📍 Step 2 — Multiple Linear Regression Formula

Linear Regression is a method where the model learns a mathematical formula to predict price based on input values.

The formula is:

Price = b0 + b1×Brand + b2×Year + b3×Engine + b4×Fuel + b5×Transmission + b6×Mileage + b7×Condition + b8×Model

What each part means:
- b0 = Base price (starting value before any features)
- b1 to b8 = Coefficients — weights the model learned from training data
- Each coefficient tells how much that feature increases or decreases the price
- Example: if b2 = 200 for Year — every 1 year newer adds ₹200 to the price
- Example: if b6 = -0.05 for Mileage — every 1 km driven reduces price by ₹0.05

---

### 📍 Step 3 — How the Model Trains

During training:
1. The model sees hundreds of rows of car data
2. It tries to find the best values for b0, b1, b2 ... b8
3. It checks how close its predictions are to actual prices
4. It adjusts the coefficients again and again until predictions are accurate
5. The error is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE = (1/n) × Σ (Actual Price - Predicted Price)²

The model tries to make this MSE as small as possible.

---

### 📍 Step 4 — Manual Calculation Example

Input from user:

Brand        = BMW        → encoded = 1
Year         = 2020
Engine Size  = 2.0
Fuel Type    = Diesel     → encoded = 1
Transmission = Automatic  → encoded = 1
Mileage      = 30000
Condition    = Used       → encoded = 1
Model        = 5 Series   → encoded = 1

Model coefficients (example values):

b0  =  5000   (base price)
b1  =  3000   (Brand)
b2  =  200    (Year)
b3  =  1500   (Engine Size)
b4  =  500    (Fuel Type)
b5  =  1000   (Transmission)
b6  = -0.05   (Mileage — negative means more km = lower price)
b7  = -2000   (Condition — Used = lower price)
b8  =  1200   (Model)

Applying the formula:

Price = 5000
      + (3000  × 1)      =  3000    → BMW brand
      + (200   × 2020)   =  404000  → Year 2020
      + (1500  × 2.0)    =  3000    → Engine 2.0L
      + (500   × 1)      =  500     → Diesel
      + (1000  × 1)      =  1000    → Automatic
      + (-0.05 × 30000)  = -1500    → 30000 km driven
      + (-2000 × 1)      = -2000    → Used condition
      + (1200  × 1)      =  1200    → 5 Series model

Price = 5000 + 3000 + 404000 + 3000 + 500 + 1000 - 1500 - 2000 + 1200

Price = ₹ 4,15,200 (approximately)

> ✅ In real code, scikit-learn automatically finds the best coefficients. We do not set them manually.

### 📍 Step 5 — Train Test Split

Before training we split the dataset into two parts:

Total Dataset  →  100%
Training Data  →   80%  ← Model learns from this
Testing Data   →   20%  ← Model is tested on unseen data

Why do we split?
- If we train and test on the same data the model will just memorize it
- Testing on unseen data tells us how well the model works in real life
- This is called checking for Overfitting

---

### 📍 Step 6 — Model Accuracy Metrics

R² Score:
R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
Value between 0 and 1. Closer to 1 means the model is very accurate.
Example: R² = 0.92 means model explains 92% of price variation.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE = Average of |Actual Price - Predicted Price|
Average difference between actual and predicted price. Lower is better.

Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE = Average of (Actual Price - Predicted Price)²
Penalizes large errors more. Lower is better.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE = √MSE
Same unit as price so easier to understand. Lower is better.

## 📈 Visualizations — Graphs Plotted

### 1. 📊 Brand vs Average Price (Bar Chart)
- X-axis: Car Brand
- Y-axis: Average Price
- Finding: Tesla and Mercedes have the highest average prices. Honda and Toyota are more affordable.

### 2. 📉 Mileage vs Price (Scatter Plot)
- X-axis: Mileage (km driven)
- Y-axis: Car Price
- Finding: As mileage increases price goes down — negative correlation. More km driven means more wear and tear so lower price.

### 3. 📈 Year vs Price (Scatter Plot)
- X-axis: Year of Manufacture
- Y-axis: Car Price
- Finding: Newer cars have higher prices — positive correlation.

### 4. 🥧 Fuel Type Distribution (Pie Chart)
- Shows what percentage of cars use Petrol vs Diesel
- Finding: Most cars in the dataset are Petrol-powered.

### 5. 🌡️ Correlation Heatmap
- Shows how strongly each feature is connected to Price
- Finding: Year and Engine Size have the strongest positive connection with Price. Mileage has a negative connection.

### 6. 🎯 Actual vs Predicted Price (Scatter Plot)
- X-axis: Actual Price
- Y-axis: Predicted Price by Model
- Finding: Most points are close to the diagonal line which means model predictions are very close to real prices.
